# Silent City Dashboard

Prototype repository for a probing confidence score to estimate coordinated probes across civic services.

---

## Context
Not every cyberattack looks like a blackout.  
The more dangerous scenario is a silent choke: multiple small glitches across payments, transport, and civic systems.  
Confidence collapses before systems fully fail.
